# About Melbourne
Melbourne holds the distinction of being the second most populous city in both Australia and Oceania. As the center of south Australia, Melbourne is a sprawling urban area spanning 9,992 km2, which encompasses a metropolitan region comprising 31 municipalities ([Source: Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)). It has a population of 5 million, which takes up 19% of the population of Australia.

The initiative of this narrative data story is to provide you with an opportunity to delve into Melbourne's city life through various data sets, including demographics, residential information, and employment data. By examining these aspects, you can see the potential opportunities in the city. Furthermore, we want to show the pictures of the future for Melbourne by applying the city's forecasts data, and provide you with the insights of the city's future development.
