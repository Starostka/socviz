# Why is this important?
Population growth is impacting our planet in many ways. According to [Population Media Center](https://www.populationmedia.org/blog/does-population-growth-impact-global-climate-change?utm_term=&utm_campaign=Donation+/+Web+Traffic+Campaign&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_tgt=dsa-1020761732591&hsa_grp=142853052400&hsa_src=g&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_mt=&hsa_ver=3&hsa_ad=617507170220&hsa_acc=7272581478&hsa_kw=&hsa_cam=83417258&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpPKiBhDvARIsACn-gzBuFGSSn3ExyFsGWUXpJfkNWtFx3x6DbWt23NM6-tFgm1qkeA5XwkIaAoadEALw_wcB), when looking back over the last several centuries, global population trends show continuous expansion, both in terms of volume and rapidity. Population is the key factor in the climate crisis, housing and infrastructure, economic growth of a country, and so on. Therefore, a proper forecast of population growth can guide the society to make better decisions in the future.

positive correlation with GDP, CO2, housing, etc.

<!-- ## Historic validation
> WIP

- TODO: Validate forecast analysis by comparing with historical data.
- TODO: Validation by historic data is important to assess the accuracy and reliability of the forecasts. Else our claims are hard to trust. -->
