Welcome to the site of SocViz, a project created as part of the Social Data & Visualization course taught at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

The site currently features two investigations:
- An investigation into crime activities across various police districts in San Francisco.
- An investigation into forecast data for Melbourne, Australia.

Our aim is to present our findings in a concise and engaging manner through appealing visuals and interactive plots.

The site's design is built on a custom implementation that takes inspiration from [Edward Tufte's principles](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) and incorporates elements from the [Neat CSS framework](https://neat.joeldare.com).

We are delighted to have you here and hope that you not only enjoy your time on the site but also learn something new as you delve deeper into our content.

# Static site generation and code execution
This site is generated using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) due to its appealing features for scientific and technical publications.

Quarto provides an extension to the Markdown formatting language through its `.qmd` file format, also known as Quarto documents. The Quarto engine can execute code blocks within these documents using the Python interpreter, preferably in a self-contained virtual environment.

These documents are processed by Haskell [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) to read and export them into various file formats, such as HTML. The resulting HTML is then presented as a static site, which we have published on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
