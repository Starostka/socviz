Welcome to Melbourne Pulse - Let's unveile Melbourne's Dynamic Story!
We are glad to introduce Melbourne urban deveploment by drawing the picture of the city through the lens of data. This is not only a story about charts and numbers, but also the story that help you get to know this vibrant and dynamic metropolis.

In our story, we will bring you the narrative data story by applying the *Magazine Style*, as it contains both descriptive information and visualization, which could create a sense of comfort and familiarity to the readers. For Visual Narrative, we used *Progress Bar/Timebar, Zooming and Feature Distinction* to describe the story in an interactive sense.

For a magazine style data narrative, it is common to use **Annotations, Accompanying Article, Introductory Text and Summary** as part of the narrative structure.

We hope you enjoy the journey with us!
