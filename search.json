    "text": "San Francisco is a well-know metropolis, as the commercial, financial and cultural center of North California in the USA, it has attracted a massive amount of people migrated and lived in the city. With 815,201 residents up to 2021, the diverse population has made impactful contribution to the economic of San Francisco. However, the wide range of socioeconomic challenges in San Francisco also contributes to the high crime rate.\n\n\nIn this story, we will explore the San Francisco Police Department’s (SFPD) Incient Report Dataset with the time frame from January 2003 to May 2018.\nThis dataset is a collection of data on criminal incidents reported in SF, which provides the information of incident date, incident time, incident category, police district, latitude, logitude, etc. The dataset contains 35 columns and more than 2 million records of crimes within the timeframe. According to the data, there were 37 categories of crimes recorded across San Francisco city.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this report is utilizing the techniques of data visualization for the analytics of crime occured in San Francisco. The primary idea of this data analysis study is to obtain the insights from the observation, in order to evaluate the criminal situation for the past decades in San Francisco, as well as help prevent potential crimes in the future. The data analysis will be based on Time-Series, Geographic and Interative Visualization respectively.\nAccording to SFNext Index, with the exception of robberies, violent crime in San Francisco is below average for large cities. In 2019 and 2020, San Francisco ranked in the bottom half among major U.S. cities, with rates of 670 and 540 violent crime incidents per 100,000 residents, respectively. Hence, we are interested in how Robbery had increased the violent crime level in San Francisco."

    "text": "Timeseries: How the occurrence of Robbery changed over the time?\n\nIf we divide the time of the incidents into hourly timeslots, it becomes apparent that the number of robberies reaches its highest point between 2 and 3 pm and remains consistently high until 5 pm. After 5 pm, there is a sharp decline during the evening, but a secondary peak occurs between 1 and 2 am.Between 2 am and 2 pm, the number of incidents increases steadily.\nFrom a 2003 to 2017, we can see the incidents fluctuated accross years. Specifically, in 2010 and 2011, it has a significant decreased from 2008 and 2009. The Rand Corporation studied this phenomenon on a national level in 2010, concluding that the crime prevention benefit of hiring more officers is well worth the cost. Reference\nHowever, there was a resurgence in incidents in 2012, with a noticeable gap from the previous year. After analyzing the robbery incidents data in 2012, we observed a marked increase in robberies on the final Sunday in June in San Francisco. Further investigation revealed that this date coincided with the San Francisco LGBT Pride Parade, which started at Beale Street and Market Street and continued down to 8th Street."

Additionally, the buildings and blocks in the Market Street area are more densely packed, offering additional cover and refuge for criminals.\nThis observation also aligns with the result of the heatmap regarding robbery in San Francisco. It reveals the fact that areas with a high concentration of stores and a large population, along with a complex urban infrastructure, are more susceptible to robbery incidents.\nCluster Correlation idea: Furthermore, we can select two clusters and a little info box pops up over the cursor printing the correlation between the two clusters."
