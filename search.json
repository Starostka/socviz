And attempt to present them by zooming in the streets seperately\nCluster Correlation idea: Furthermore, we can select two clusters and a little info box pops up over the cursor printing the correlation between the two clusters."

And maybe how drunkiness (or some other criminal activity) was related.\nQuestions - Are we limited to the dataset/timeframe? (Is it possible to look into the data after 2020 during covid?) - Can we include multiple datasets? (as supplementery)"
