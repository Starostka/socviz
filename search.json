The primary idea of this data analysis study is to obtain the insights from the observation, in order to evaluate the criminal situation for the past decades in San Francisco, as well as help prevent potential crimes in the future.\nThe data analysis will be based on Time-Series, Geographic and Interative Visualization respectively.\nAccording to SFNext Index, with the exception of robberies, violent crime in San Francisco is below average for large cities. In 2019 and 2020, San Francisco ranked in the bottom half among major U.S. cities, with rates of 670 and 540 violent crime incidents per 100,000 residents, respectively. Hence, we are interested in how Robbery had increased the violent crime level in San Francisco."

Specifically, in 2010 and 2011, it has a significant decreased from 2008 and 2009. The Rand Corporation studied this phenomenon on a national level in 2010, concluding that the crime prevention benefit of hiring more officers is well worth the cost. Reference\nHowever, there was a resurgence in incidents in 2012, with a noticeable gap from the previous year. After analyzing the robbery incidents data in 2012, we observed a marked increase in robberies on the final Sunday in June in San Francisco.\nFurther investigation revealed that this date coincided with the San Francisco LGBT Pride Parade, which started at Beale Street and Market Street and continued down to 8th Street."

The red dots indicates the location of the robberies taking place.

Additionally, the buildings and blocks in the Market Street area are more densely packed, offering additional cover and refuge for criminals.\nThis observation also aligns with the result of the heatmap regarding robbery occurrence in 2011 and 2012, as the map above indicates. It reveals the fact that areas with a high concentration of stores and a large population, along with a complex urban infrastructure, are more susceptible to robbery incidents.\nHowever, despite the fact that the Tenderloin district where Market Street located had the highest number of robbery incidents, the data implies that it was not the most active police district. This fact can be counted to the assumption that there was a lack of police power resources in Tenderloin district."

From the visualization, we can first get the information that each police district has the similar pattern of activities: almost all districts has the relatively high frequency of criminals during 7 am to 23 pm, with the peak at 11 am. It can be reflected that there are more active police resources working during day shift.\nHowever the normalized occurrence of crimes has decreased by half during 0 am to 7 am, and the bottom occurs at the timeslot of 4 am to 5 am. In general, Park District, Taravel District and Southern District were likely to have the best performance due to the relatively larger amount of crime records. Police in Tenderloin District has better performance than Central District at the timeslots of 4-7 am and 12-16 pm, however, however it was less performed than Central District from 17 pm to 3 am.\nHowever, by inspecting in the data of the total occurrence of all categories of crimes, we were not able to catch an apparent correlation between the pattern of crimes and the activity of police districts."
