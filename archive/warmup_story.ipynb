        "San Francisco is a renowned metropolis, situated in North California, USA, and serves as the commercial, financial, and cultural center of the region. This has attracted a significant influx of migrants to the city, and as of 2021, it has a population of 815,201 residents [up to 2021](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CASANF0POP), who have made a notable contribution to the city's economy.\n",

        "However, the city's diverse socioeconomic challenges have also contributed to a high crime rate.\n",

        "The aim of this report is utilizing the techniques of data visualization for the analytics of crime occured in San Francisco. The primary idea of this data analysis study is to obtain the insights from the observation, in order to evaluate the criminal situation for the past decades in San Francisco, as well as help prevent potential crimes in the future.\n",

In 2019 and 2020, San Francisco ranked in the bottom half among major U.S. cities, with rates of 670 and 540 violent crime incidents per 100,000 residents, respectively. Hence, we are interested in how `Robbery` had increased the violent crime level in San Francisco. \n",

        "\n",
        "As an overview, the robbery rate has decreased by 8.5% since the decade of 2003 to the last decade, however the number is not indicating a significantly decrease, which reflects the robbery is still a key factor that affect the level of crimes in San Francisco.\n",

        "If we divide the time of the incidents into hourly timeslots, it becomes apparent that the number of robberies reaches its highest point between 2 and 3 pm and remains consistently high until 5 pm. After 5 pm, there is a sharp decline during the evening, but a secondary peak occurs between 1 and 2 am.Between 2 am and 2 pm, the number of incidents increases steadily. \n"
